<div class=answer>
<p>My principle development environment is a Linux desktop system, using nginx, APC, memcached, PHP FastCGI Process Manager, and MySQL as a database.  MyWeb is deployed to a MediaTemple Grid Server, which is basically a classic LAMP setup without APC or Memcached.</p>
<p>Actual development was done in VIM and Kdevelop, with testing and inspection performed in Google Chrome.</p>
<p>MyWeb is an HTML 5 application.</p>
