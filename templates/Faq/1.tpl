<div class=answer>
<p>MyWeb is supposed to be a scratchbox and an example of my experience in myriad technologies.  A lot of this is demonstrated in the unterlying systems, and not in the final HTML output.  The <a href="https://github.com/mschnee/MyWeb">GitHub Project Page</a> is going to be the best source of information.</p>
